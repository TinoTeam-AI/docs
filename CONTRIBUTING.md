# CONTRIBUTING.md

When writing code for Tino Team projects, you must follow a number of the following rules:

> 1. Documentation
>> Each file or directory must be documented in a repository for its developers.
>>
>> All functions, classes, structures, and other code blocks with scopes in header files (.h and .hpp) must be documented in programming language comments. The comments should describe its purpose, in the case of classes or structures, the methods and fields of the classes should be described.
>> 
>> Code files (.cc and .cpp) do not require comments except for complex code blocks.
>> All files must have an [introduction](https://github.com/VaisonE/tinostream/blob/main/tinostream/cpp/tinostream.cpp)

> 2. Reclosing protection
>> All files must be protected against re-inclusion <#pragma once>

> 3. Style 
>> All code in scopes must be written with tabs, this also applies to private, public, protected modifiers


Perhaps in the future these rules can be supplemented.
